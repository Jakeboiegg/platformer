# Belvis go jumpy wooo
hii this just a simple platformer in pygame

Made as a hobby so don't expect it to be polished at all

![game photo](images/game_photo.png)

## CONTROLS
Arrow keys except up to move

Space to jump

## INSTALLATION
make sure to have pygame installed on your machine

Use

pip install pygame 

-or-

pip3 install pygame

in terminal

## Booting the Game
ONLY IDLE can be used to launch game, any other software will cause issues
(not Xcode)

Just click run after launching platformer.py

## Stuff to add (future)
- [ ] cool photo on readme file, with real bebis
- [ ] homepage / endscreen 
- [ ] better wall colision
